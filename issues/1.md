# Game Fails to Start: Potential Unity Editor Configuration Errors

Based on an analysis of the codebase, the "nothing happens" issue at launch is likely due to misconfiguration in the Unity Editor rather than code bugs. Since there are no compilation errors, the problem is probably at runtime. Here are the most likely causes:

### 1. Unassigned Prefabs in GameManager
The `GameManager.cs` script has public fields for `playerTankPrefab` and `aiTankPrefab`. If these are not assigned in the Unity Inspector, the `Instantiate()` calls will fail, and no tanks will appear in the scene.

**Solution:**
1. Select the GameObject that has the `GameManager` component attached.
2. In the Inspector, locate the `Game Manager` component.
3. Drag your player tank prefab into the **Player Tank Prefab** field.
4. Drag your AI tank prefab into the **Ai Tank Prefab** field.

### 2. Missing or Unassigned Spawn Points
The `GameManager` also requires arrays of `Transform` objects for `teamASpawnPoints` and `teamBSpawnPoints`. If these arrays are empty, the game won't know where to place the tanks.

**Solution:**
1. Create at least one empty GameObject for Team A's spawn and three for Team B.
2. In the `GameManager` Inspector, lock the inspector view.
3. Select the spawn point GameObjects in the Hierarchy and drag them into the **Team A Spawn Points** and **Team B Spawn Points** arrays.

### 3. "Player" Tag is Not Set
The `GameUI` and `CameraController` scripts find the player tank using `GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player")`. If your player tank prefab does not have this tag, the camera will not follow the player and the UI will not be connected.

**Solution:**
1. Select your player tank prefab.
2. At the top of the Inspector, click the **Tag** dropdown and select **Player**. If the tag doesn't exist, you will need to add it first.

### 4. Input Manager Not Configured
The tank's movement is handled by `Input.GetAxis("Vertical")`, `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")`, and firing with `Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1")`. These are default Unity inputs, but if they have been altered, controls will not work.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Edit > Project Settings > Input Manager**.
2. Ensure that the axes "Vertical", "Horizontal", and "Fire1" exist and are configured correctly (e.g., for keyboard and mouse input).
